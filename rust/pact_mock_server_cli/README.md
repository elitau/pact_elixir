# Standalone Pact Mock Server

This project provides both a restful web api and command line interface to run pact mock servers. It is a single
executable binary and is able to manage multiple mock servers. The lifecycle of each mock server can be controlled by the
restful web api or through the command line interface. It implements the [V1.1 Pact specification](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification/tree/version-1.1).

[Online rust docs](http://www.pact.io/reference/rust/pact_mock_server_cli-docs-latest/pact_mock_server_cli/)

## Command line interface

The mock server is bundles as a single binary executable `pact_mock_server_cli`. Running this with out any options displays
the standard help.

```console
./pact_mock_server_cli v0.0.1
Standalone Pact mock server

USAGE:
    pact_mock_server_cli [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
        --help       Prints help information
    -v, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -h, --host <host>            hostname the master mock server runs on (defaults to localhost)
    -l, --loglevel <loglevel>    Log level for mock servers to write to the log file (defaults to info) [values: error, warn,
                                 info, debug, trace, none]
    -p, --port <port>            port the master mock server runs on (defaults to 8080)

SUBCOMMANDS:
    create      Creates a new mock server from a pact file
    help        Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    list        Lists all the running mock servers
    shutdown    Shutdown the mock server by id or port number, releasing all its resources
    start       Starts the master mock server
    verify      Verify the mock server by id or port number, and generate a pact file if all ok
```

### Options

The following options are available for all subcommands:

#### Host: -h, --host <host>

This sets the host the master mock server runs on. By default this will be localhost.

#### Port: -p, --port <port>

This sets the port that the master mock server runs on. By default this will be 8080. The start command will start the
master server using this port.

#### Log level: -l, --loglevel <loglevel>

This sets the log level that the CLI and mock servers log at. It defaults to info. Valid values are: error, warn,
info, debug, trace, none.

### Sub-commands

#### help

This prints either the main help or the help for a sub-command.

#### start

This starts the master mock server. This server needs to be running for the other sub-commands to work.

```console
$ ./pact_mock_server_cli help start
start v0.0.1
Starts the master mock server

USAGE:
    start [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
        --help    Prints help information

```

##### Options

###### Output directory: -o, --output <output>

This sets the output directory that log files and pact files are written to. It defaults to the current working directory.

##### Example

15:40:08 [DEBUG] hyper::server: threads = 10
15:40:08 [INFO] pact_mock_server_cli::server: Server started on port 8080
```

#### create

This creates a new pact mock server managed by the master server from a pact file. The ID and port of the mock server
will be displayed.

```console
$ ./pact_mock_server_cli help create

Creates a new mock server from a pact file

USAGE:
    create [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] --file <file>

FLAGS:
        --help    Prints help information

OPTIONS:

```

##### Options

###### Pact File: -f, --file <file>

This option specifies the pact file to base the mock server on. It is a mandatory option.

##### Example

```console
$ ./pact_mock_server_cli create -f ../../../libpact_matching/tests/pact.json
15:43:47 [INFO] pact_mock_server_cli::create_mock: Creating mock server from file ../../../libpact_matching/tests/pact.json
Mock server "7d1bf906d0ff42528f2d7d794dd19c5b" started on port 52943
```

#### list

Lists out all running mock servers with their ID, port, provider name and status.

```console
$ ./pact_mock_server_cli list --help
pact_mock_server_cli-list v0.0.1

USAGE:
    pact_mock_server_cli list [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

```

#### verify

This checks that the mock server, specified by ID or port number, has met all the expectations of the pact file. If all
expectations have been met, the pact file will be written out to the output directory that was specified with the start
sub-command. If there is any errors, no pact file will be written and the errors displayed to the console.

```console
$ ./pact_mock_server_cli verify --help
pact_mock_server_cli-verify v0.0.1
Verify the mock server by id or port number, and generate a pact file if all ok

## Restful JSON API

The master mock server provides a restful JSON API, and this API is what the command line sub-commands use to
communicate and control the master server.

### End points

#### GET /

This returns a list of all running mock servers managed by this master server.

example request:

```
GET http://localhost:8080/ HTTP/1.1
```

example response:

```json
{
  "mockServers": [
    {
      "id": "7d1bf906d0ff42528f2d7d794dd19c5b",
      "port": 52943,
      "provider": "Alice Service",
      "status": "ok"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### POST /

This creates a new mock server from a pact file that must be present as JSON in the body. Returns the details of the mock server
in the response.

example request:

```
POST http://localhost:8080/ HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
```

payload:

```json

          "Content-Type": "text/html"
        },
        "body": "\"That is some good Mallory.\""
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

example response:

  "mockServer": {
    "id": "81c3483901e647ba8f545f2842d09cba",
    "port": 58276
  }
}
```

#### Response codes

##### 200 OK

This is returned when if the mock server was created successfully.

##### 422 Unprocessable Entity

This is returned if the pact JSON could not be parsed or the mock server could not be started.

#### GET /mockserver/:id

Returns details of the mock server with `:id`, which can be either a mockserver ID or port number.

example request:

```
GET http://localhost:8080/mockserver/33218 HTTP/1.1
```

example response:

```json
{

  "provider": "Alice Service",
  "status": "error"
}
```

#### Response codes

##### 200 OK

This is returned with a valid mockserver.

##### 404 Not Found

This is returned if no mock server was found with the given ID or port number.

#### POST /mockserver/:id/verify

This checks that the mock server, specified by ID or port number, has met all the expectations of the pact file. If all
expectations have been met, the pact file will be written out to the output directory that was specified with the start
sub-command. If any mismatched requests where received by the mock server, they will be returned.

example request:

```
POST http://localhost:8080/mockserver/33218/verify HTTP/1.1
```

#### Response codes

##### 204 No Content

This is returned when all expectations have been successfully met and the pact file has been written out to the output directory.

##### 422 Unprocessable Entity

This is returned if any expectations have not been met, or any unrecognised requests where received. The details are
returned in the body.

example response:

```json
{
  "mismatches": [
    {
      "method": "GET",
      "path": "/mallory",
      "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "path": "/mallory",
        "query": "name=ron&status=good"
      },
      "type": "missing-request"
    }
  ],
  "mockServer": {
    "id": "3201b3e2f04f402c83b374a077f8f8dd",
    "port": 33218,
    "provider": "Alice Service",
    "status": "error"
  }
}
```

##### 404 Not Found

This is returned if the ID or port number did not correspond to a running mock server or the pact file could not be
written.

#### DELETE /mockserver/:id

Shuts down the mock server with `:id`, which can be either a mockserver ID or port number.

example request:

```
DELETE http://localhost:8080/mockserver/33218 HTTP/1.1
```

#### Response codes

##### 204 No Content

This is returned when the mock server has been shutdown.
